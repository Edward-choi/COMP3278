# How to add new Icon

* We use **Font Awesome** in this repository
* You can search free icons here:
  * https://fontawesome.com/v6/icons?m=free
* We follow this way to import icons from **Font Awesome**:
  * https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/react/add-icons#add-individual-icons-explicitly

## Why we don't use **Dynamic Icon Importing**?
* This's because we are not using Babel in this repository. We try to follow Next.js latest version change to adopt SWC[^1]?
